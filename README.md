# BAURPM
Basic Arch User Repository (AUR) Package Manager

A basic AUR helper that I wrote for personal use on my Archlinux system

## Disclaimer
This is a small personal project that is still a work in progress so not everything is implemented.
Also the code is not guaranteed to be high quality as it is just for a personal project.

I have uploaded this to github in case of someone wanting to use it and/or to properly develop it.
